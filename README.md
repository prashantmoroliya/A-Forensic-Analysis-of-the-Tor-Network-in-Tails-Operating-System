# A Forensic Analysis of the Tor Network in Tails Operating System

The Tor network is a crucial tool for online privacy, enabling users to communicate and access information anonymously. However, the anonymity and untraceability of transactions on the dark web pose significant challenges for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in monitoring and investigating criminal activities. This study focuses on forensic analysis of the unencrypted layer in the Tor network to assess how network traffic analysis can expose users' online activities for criminal investigations. The research methodology involves capturing and analyzing network traffic from the Tor Browser running on the Tails operating system, with particular emphasis on the unencrypted layer of the network. The key findings reveal that it is possible to de-anonymize Tor users and identify their online activities by examining the unencrypted headers of network packets. These findings have profound implications for LEAs and cybersecurity professionals, highlighting that while Tor is a valuable tool for privacy, it is not without risks. Users must implement additional safeguards to ensure their privacy and security when using the network.
